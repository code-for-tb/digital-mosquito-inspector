# Digital Mosquito Inspector

## Created by: Sam Harden, Shenole Latimer, and John Brock.

This web app is being designed for Code for Tampa Bay's Hack Zika 2017. It's designed to help citizens **identify** potential mosquito breeding sites as well as **teach** citizens about mosquitos and mosquito control.

Thanks to Code for Tampa Bay for putting on the [Hackathon][http://codefortampabay.org/zika-hackathon/], the [Halton Region][http://www.halton.ca/cms/One.aspx?portalId=8310&pageId=9933] for their excellent mosquito control resources, and bootstrap for making the front end quick and easy to get up and running.
